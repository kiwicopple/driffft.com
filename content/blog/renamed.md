### Introduction

We started experimenting with Mixed Reality in 2013. Since this was before the arrival of Google Glass, Microsoft Hololens, and Magic Leap, we used available consumer devices to create an augmented glasses. These glasses provided an augmented experience using Google StreetView. These early experiments provided the fundamental insights for exaQuark, a Mixed Reality platform which can scale to millions of users.
